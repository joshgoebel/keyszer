**Describe the bug or unexpected behavior**
<!-- A clear and concise description of the bug or incorrect behavior. -->


**Sample Config or Instructions to Reproduce**
<!--
Please include step-by-step instructions when possible to reproduce the bug you are seeing.  If you're using a custom configuration file please attach that; or at lest the relevant part if your struggling with a particular mapping or conditional, etc.  Often a verbose log (`keyszer -v`) of output can help for really complex stucky key or incorrect keypress situations. -->

**Your setup**

- Python version:
- Keyszer version:
- Kinto version (if applicable):
- Devices `(+K)` we're handling input from:

<!--
The (+K) lines from a verbose log look like:

(+K) Grabbing Microsoft Mouse with IntelliEye(TM) (/dev/input/event2)
(+K) Grabbing Apple, Inc Apple Keyboard (/dev/input/event3) -->

**Expected behavior**
<!--
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.  If a screen grab would help, attach one. -->

**Additional context**
<!--
Add any other context about the problem here. -->
